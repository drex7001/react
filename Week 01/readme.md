# Getting Started with React

To start a new React project, you can use Create React App, which sets up a modern web app by running one command. Here's how to do it:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to create a new React project:

   ```
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   ```

   Replace `my-react-app` with your desired project name.

4. Once the installation is complete, navigate to your project folder:

   ```
   cd my-react-app
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

Your new React application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you're ready to start building your React application! The project structure will look like this:
